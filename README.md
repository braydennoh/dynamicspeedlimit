The objective was to create a speed limit system based on surrounding weather conditions. 

The system can sense rain intensity and fog visibility. Values obtained are used as calculation inputs. 

v = [-2 + √(4+2* s / 9.8 * f )] * (9.8 * f ) 

v is recommended vehicle speed, s is driver visibility, and f is road surface friction.
